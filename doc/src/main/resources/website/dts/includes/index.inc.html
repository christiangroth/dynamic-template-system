<h2>Dynamic Template System</h2>
<p>Dynamic Template System generates output based on templates. It takes a template and generates the content for all 
placeholders using parameters and generics. Afterwards the output can be just returned to any application using 
Dynamic Template System or saved into a file.</p>

<p>So why do you call it 'dynamic'? ... well the output format is not limited to xml, (x)html or whatever. You can generate 
output in any format you want. Perhaps you want to generate php, javascript or css files? Along with xhtml? All in one
project? Just do it, it's really that easy as you will see in this guide.</p>
